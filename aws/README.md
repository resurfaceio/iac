## Running Graylog API Security on EKS

The recommended way to deploy Graylog API Security.

### Do you want to try Graylog API Security but you don't have a Kubernetes cluster yet?

No problem! Our templates will help you get started with Graylog API Security in minutes. In fact, you won't even have to leave your browser before you have a brand new EKS cluster running your own self-hosted Graylog API Security instance.

Click the **Launch Stack** button below to deploy Graylog API Security together with all the necessary resources as a [CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html):

[![Launch AWS Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?stackName=eks-graylog-api-security&templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fapisec-cf-templates.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Feks%2Feks-all.json)

            <li>A number of network resources, including a new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html">VPC</a> with 3 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html">subnets</a>, and an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html">internet gateway</a> to provide the EKS Cluster with internet access.</li>
            <li>
              A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html">nested CloudFormation stack</a> that, in turn, creates and deploys:

This way the provisioned Graylog API Security cluster is both <a href="https://resurface.io/docs#enabling-tls">TLS</a> and <a href="https://resurface.io/docs#enabling-iceberg-storage">Iceberg</a> ready.</li>
                <li>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html#CoreConcepts">S3 bucket</a> to host a static website with post-installation notes</li>

**Parameters**:

- Choose both a name for you cluster (*EKSClusterName*), and 3 availability zones (*SubnetAZs*) to create the subnets for your cluster.

    - If installing a single-node cluster it is recommended to decrease the EKS node count (*EKSNodeCount*) to 1.
    - If the CloudFormation stack deployment fails, please choose 3 different availability zones and try again.
  

- Make sure to allow CloudFormation to create both IAM resources and nested stacks (`CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`)

üèÅ That's it!

### Do you already have an EKS cluster?

Even better! Our template will help you get started with Graylog API Security without having to run `kubectl`, `helm` or any commands at all. In fact, you won't even have to leave your browser before you are running your own self-hosted Graylog API Security instance.

Click the Launch Stack button below to deploy all necessary resources as a [CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html):

[![Launch AWS Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/review?stackName=eks-graylog-api-security&templateURL=https%3A%2F%2Fapisec-cf-templates.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Feks%2Fnested%2Fec2-chart-installer.json)

> [!NOTE]
> This uses a custom template to create and deploy:
> 1. A self-terminating [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html) that connects to the newly-created EKS cluster and uses [helm](https://resurface.io/docs#using-helm) to install both the [Graylog API Security chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/resurfaceio/resurface), and the [Cert-manager](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cert-manager/cert-manager/) dependency. This way the provisioned Graylog API Security cluster is both [TLS](https://resurface.io/docs#enabling-tls) and [Iceberg](https://resurface.io/docs#enabling-iceberg-storage) ready.
> 2. An [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html#CoreConcepts) to host a static website with post-installation notes.
> 3. The corresponding [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) and policies, EC2 instance profiles, and [EKS access entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html) required to create and deploy new EC2 instances, and connect to your EKS cluster.

Once the automatic deployment finishes, go to the **Outputs** section and click on the **SuccessURL** link.
